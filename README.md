This Jupyter notebook presents a simple way of simulating dynamics of high-diversity ecosystems explicitly in space. 

## Dependencies
Requires python libraries scipy, numpy, matplotlib, networkx, itertools.

## Usage notes:
The implemented instance is on a 2-dimensional grid with periodic boundary conditions. More complex graph geometries can be also be incorporated using networkx.
